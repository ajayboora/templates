Various templates I use to show/present my work.

## poster
A beamer poster template that will evolve over time. It's fairly basic but the
order/number of columns can be changed easily and it has nice colors.

## presentation
A beamer presentation template that will evolve over time. This is meant to be
used with Adobe Reader and [osx-beamer-presentation] (but doesn't have to be).
It includes examples on how to include video/animations.

## SShw.tplx
A template to make the conversion between IPython notebooks and
PDFs look *really* nice when using `ipython nbconvert`. There are more details inside
this file (in the comments). Mostly, it allows you to format the title page.

## interactive.ipynb
An interactive IPython notebook that includes an
interactive widget. It also includes (in my opinion) the simplest framework
for making static interactive online widgets that can go on a web page
(example shown with widget.html).
