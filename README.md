## poster/

## presentation/
A beamer presentation template that will evolve over
time. This is meant to be used with [osx-beamer-presentation]

## SShw.tplx
A template to make the conversion between IPython notebooks and
PDFs look *really* nice when using `ipython nbconvert`. There are more details inside
this file (in the comments).

## interactive.ipynb
An interactive IPython notebook that includes an
interactive widget. It also includes (in my opinion) the simplest framework
for making static interactive online widgets that can go on a web page
(example shown with widget.html).
