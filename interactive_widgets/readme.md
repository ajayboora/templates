This uses the library [ipywidgets-unsupported] as IPython does not yet support
*static interactive* widgets. Related: [ipython/ipythonwidgets issue #16]

The file `2015-inverse-blur_l2_reg.html` contains example code to have two
sliders that when a slider is moved, some MathJax text is updated. Adapt as you
wish!

Also, note that this code is at the bottom of the script.
